# Stable Clinical Risk Prediction against Distribution Shift in Electronic Health Records

## Introduction
This repository contains source code for paper "Stable Clinical Risk Prediction against Distribution Shift in Electronic Health Records".

The availability of large-scale electronic health record (EHR) datasets has led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for clinical risk prediction that help improve patient care.
However, existing studies have shown that AI models suffer from severe performance decay after several years of deployment, which might be caused by various temporal dataset shifts (e.g., the distribution of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code changes when transiting ICD version from ICD-9 to ICD-10). When the dataset shift occurs, we have access to large-scale pre-shift data and small-scale post-shift data that are not enough to train new models in the post-shift environment.
In this study, we propose a new method to address the issue for clinical risk prediction. We re-weight patients collected from the pre-shift environment to mitigate the distribution shift between pre- and post-shift environments. Moreover, we adopt a Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence loss to force the models to learn similar patient representations in pre- and post-shift environments.  Our experimental results indicate that our model trained on large-scale pre-shift data outperforms the baselines trained on small-scale post-shift data by about 17\% and improves existing models trained with pre-shift data by more than 3.5\% with our methods.

## Preprocessing data

### Dataset
Please be informed that the dataset utilized in this study is derived from MarketScan claims data. To obtain access to the data, interested parties are advised to contact IBM through the following link: [https://www.merative.com/real-world-evidence].

### Input data demo
For your convenience, a demo version of the input data can be found in the data folder. It includes the data structures and a synthetic demonstration of the inputs. Prior to executing the preprocessing codes, please ensure that the format of your input data matches the format provided in the input demo. 

The detailed descriptions of each variable in the dataset can be found in the README.md in the data folder. Please refer to the README.md for comprehensive explanations of the dataset variables. 

### Preprocess
The demo dataset serves solely as a reference for the input data format. 
It is not possible to run the training code using preprocessed data from the demo dataset. 
Please utilize the preprocessed data provided in the "pickles" folder to run the training code.

```python 
python preprocess/run_preprocessing.py --input_dir 'data' --pred_windows 90 180 --min_visits 10
```

### Parameters
>
* `input_dir`: path to datset.
* `pred_windows`: prediction windows.
* `min_visits`: minimum number of visits for each patient.

## Training and test
### Python command
To run the training code using the provided data, please use the parameters --time 90 and --target 'HF'
```python 
# Note: Here's just a demo case for parameter selection. They can be easily adjusted for different application scenario. 
python train.py --config 'json/Dipole.json' --model 'Dipole' --target 'HF' --version 'weight' --time 90 --day_dim 100 --rnn_hidden 100 --steps 500 --weight_decay 0.001 --step_lr 0.001 --dist_weight 1e+7 --kl_weight 1e+4 --kl_dim 64
```

### Parameters
Hyper-parameters are set in config/*.json
>
* `early_stop`: the number of epochs for early stopping
* `monitor`: the criterian for early stopping. The first word is 'min' or 'max', the second one is metric
